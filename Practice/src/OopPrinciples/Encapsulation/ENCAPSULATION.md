# Encapsulation 

## Concept

- Encapsulation is the concept of restricting access to some of the object's components.

## What the program does 

- Creates two separate classes to represent the difference between allowing 
public access to a method in the BadBankAccount class versus creating private
methods to restrict accss in the BankAccount class.
- The BadBankAccount  class defines a public method that can be updated by
anyone.
- The BankAccount class defines a private balance variable, defines a default
constructor, and parameterized constructor.
- BankAccount defines getters and setters, and Deposit() and Withdraw() methods.
- The programs main method creates a new instance of the respective classes to 
invoke the checker method output.
