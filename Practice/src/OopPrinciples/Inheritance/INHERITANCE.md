# Inheritance

## Concept

- Inheritance is the concept of creating a new class using the properties and methods of an existing class.
- The new class is called a derived class or child class.
- The existing class is called a base class or parent class.
- The derived class inherits the properties and methods of the base class.
- The derived class can also have its own properties and methods.
- The derived class can override the properties and methods of the base class.
- Inheritance is described as an "is-A" relationship.

## What the program does

 - When there is a "is-a" relationship between classes, and subclass objects
 can be treated as instances of their superclass.
 - when you want to promote code reuse by ineriting properties and behaviors
 from existing classes.
 - When you want to leverage polymorphism to allow objects of different
 subclasses to be treated uniformly through their common superclass interface.
