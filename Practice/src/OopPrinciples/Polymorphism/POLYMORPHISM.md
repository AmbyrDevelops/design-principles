# Polymorphism

## Concept

- Poly means many, morphism means forms
- Polymorphism is the ability to present the same interface for different data types
- Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon
- Polymorphism is often expressed as "one interface, many implementations"
- Polymorphism is described as an "is-A" relationship.

## What the program does

- List of vehicles cotaining instances containing different types of vehicles
- Polymorphism allows us to treat all these instances as if they were of the same type
- This is possible because all these classes inherit from the same base class
- All these types  of vehicles are safely called in the inspection loop without worrying about the type of vehicle
