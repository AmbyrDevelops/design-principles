# Composition

## Concept

- Composition involves creating complex objects by combining simpler objects or components.
- In composition, objects are assembld ogether to form larger structures,
with each component object maintaining its own state and behavior.
- Composition is often described in terms of a "has-a" relationship.

## When to use Composition:

- When you need more flexibility in construting objects by assembly smaller,
reusable components.
- When there is no clear "is-a" relationship between classes, and a "has-a"
relationship is more Practiceropriate.
- When you want to avoid the limitations of inheritance, such as tight coupling
and the fragile base class problem.
