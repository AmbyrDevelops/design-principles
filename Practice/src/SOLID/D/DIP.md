# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend
on abstraction.
- Strategy of depending on interfaces or abstract classes rather than concrete
classes.
- Promotes decoupling between modules and promotes use of interfaces or abstract classes to define dependencies for more flexible code.
