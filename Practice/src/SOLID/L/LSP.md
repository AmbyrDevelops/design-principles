# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclass
without affecting the correctness of the program.
- Ensures hierarchies are well-designed and subclasses adhere to the contracts
defined by their superclasses.
- Violations of this principle can lead to unexpected errors and making code
hard to read and maintain.
